<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">The Witcher</a> (Polish: Wiedźmin, Polish pronunciation: [ˈvʲɛd͡ʑmʲin]) is a <strong>fantasy series of novels and short stories</strong> written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski.
The series revolves around the titular "witcher", Geralt of Rivia.
In Sapkowski's works, "witchers" are <strong>beast hunters who develop <u>supernatural abilities</u> at a young age to battle wild beasts and monsters.</strong>
The books have been adapted into a film (The Hexer), two television series (The Hexer and The Witcher), three video games (The Witcher, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt), and a graphic novel series. The series of novels is known as the Witcher Saga.
The short stories and novels have been translated into numerous languages, including English, French, Italian and Spanish.
The books have been described as having a cult following in Poland and in Central and Eastern European countries.[1][2] The video games have been very successful, and as of March 2018, they have sold over 33 million copies worldwide.

In 1996 and 1997 a Witcher video game was being developed by Metropolis Software in Poland, but it was canceled.
<br>The game's director was Adrian Chmielarz, former People Can Fly co-owner and creative director, who coined the translation "The Witcher" during its development.
<br>According to Chmielarz, the game would have been a 3D action-adventure game with role-playing elements such as moral choices and experience points.[57]
<br><br>In 2003, Polish video-game developer CD Projekt Red negotiated with Sapkowski for rights to The Witcher, given the languishing work at Metropolis,[58] and released The Witcher, a role-playing game based on the saga in October 2007 for personal computers.
It was well-publicized and, although it was the developer's first game, it received critical praise in Europe and North America.
The Witcher was published in Poland by CD Projekt and worldwide by Atari.
A console version, The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf with the same story and a different engine and combat system, was scheduled for release in fall 2009 but was canceled that spring.
The Witcher: Crimson Trail (Polish: Wiedźmin: Krwawy Szlak), also known as The Witcher Mobile is a mobile-phone action game created by Breakpoint on license from CD Projekt in November 2007.[59]
It features a young Geralt as a promising student who has completed his training to become a monster-slayer – a witcher.
The Witcher: Versus was a Flash-based multiplayer fighting browser game, developed for CD Projekt Red by one2tribe and released in 2008.
In the game, which has been discontinued, players created a character from one of three classes and challenged other players in battle.[citation needed]
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is the sequel to The Witcher, developed by CD Projekt Red.
On September 16, 2009, before Assassins of Kings was introduced, a video of the game was leaked;[60] two days later, CD Projekt Red confirmed that it was in development.[61]
Assassins of Kings was published in Poland by CD Projekt, by Namco Bandai Games in Europe and by Atari in North America.
The game was also distributed digitally through Steam and DRM-free on Good Old Games.
CD Projekt Red announced The Witcher: Battle Arena, a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena game for mobile devices, on July 1, 2014.[62]
<p style="margin-top:60px;">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was released on May 19, 2015, and has become considered one of the greatest games of all time, shipping over ten million copies by March 2016.[63] By March 2018, the series as a whole has sold over 33 million.[64]
Geralt appeared as a guest character in the 2018 fighting game, Soulcalibur VI.[65]
In October 2018, Sapkowski sent notice to CD Projekt demanding he be remunerated for sales of The Witcher video games, asking for more than 60 million Polish złoty (more than US$15 million) representing between about 5% and 15% of the game's revenues over the years.
Sapkowski had originally provided the license to CD Projekt based on a lump sum payment, but now believes he is due more since the series has become much more successful than expected. CD Projekt stated that while they had met all obligations on the initial acquisition of the license, they will work amicably with Sapkowski's legal representatives to come to a fair outcome for all parties.[66]
By February 2019, CD Projekt worked out a settlement agreement that would provide Sapkowski additional royalties for their video game series, though not as great as those Sapkowski had asked for, as to maintain a working relationship with the author for future Witcher projects.[67]
The settlement was finalized by December 2019.[68]</p>
